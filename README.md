# PnetPhlix

__PnetPhlix is a movie database recommender that gives users movie recommendations.__ 
* I implemented an algorithm that'll analyze past movies (and its associated attributes) a user has previously watched and identifies new movies for a user to watch using datasets
* This project contains a special emphasis on the usage of trees and hash maps
* treemm.h contains my implementation of a multi-map data structure that maps a key to numerous values based off a binary search tree
* Recommender class uses numerous hash-maps to minimize time spent on providing recommendations

Side Note: I didn't upload the user and movie data due to the sheer size of the datasets

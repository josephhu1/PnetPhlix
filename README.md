# PnetPhlix

PnetPhlix is a movie database recommender that gives users movie recommendations. The algorithm is designed so that it analyzes past movies (and its associated attributes) a user has watched and identifies new movies for a user to watch. This project contains a special emphasis on the usage of trees and hash-maps. 

treemm.h contains my own implementation of a multimap data structure that maps a key to numerous values based off a binary search tree.

Recommender class uses numerous hash-maps to minimize time spent for compiler to provide movie recommendations

I did not upload the data of the users and movies due to the huge size of the .txt files
